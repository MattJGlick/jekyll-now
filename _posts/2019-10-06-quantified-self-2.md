title: My Quantified Self (Part 2)
---

In my previous post I outlined all of the ways that I've attempted to quantify my life over the years.  In this post I'm going to dive into the applications that I've found only recently! I was looking to be able to track my running, sleeping and screen time. Luckily I was able to find easy ways of tracking all of those!

## What I've found more recently

### [RescueTime](rescuetime.com/)

RescueTime is an application that I run on all of my devices: laptops, desktop, and smart phone. It then tracks every single application that I'm using and for how long I'm using it. Throughout the day it collects that information and puts it into 5 different levels of productivity. This lets me get an accurate picture of what I did throughout the day and how much time I spent on a certain activity. Which helps me stay on top of whether I'm spending too much time in Slack, meetings, etc. One super interesting thing that I found is that it will actually track two devices at once. If I'm watching a movie on one computer and then working on something in another, it will track 2 hours of activity for one hour.

### [Strava](https://strava.com)

I've started running in the last couple of weeks and wanted to track how far and how long my runs are. The best app that I've found so far for this is Strava. It has some solid GPS features, different types of running settings and good time tracking. Further, it has a lot of integration with other applications that allows me to link the data in one place.

### [Withings](https://withings.com)

I had a normal scale, but never had a smart scale. As I started digging further into the quantified self, I found wifi scales! The one that seemed to come most highly reviewed was the [Withings Body+](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071XW4C5Q). I bought the scale, got the app and was all ready to start tracking my weight in an easier way!

### Google Fit

Using this to track my steps. 

### [Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe)

Gyroscope is the final piece of the puzzle. It's a dashboard to view everything else. I've got it integrated with:
- Rescue Time
- Strava
- Withings (through Fitbit)
- Google Fit

## Conclusions

What am I going to do with all this data? Who knows. Ideally I'll take it, see what correlations I can make between activities and maybe use that to fine tune my life! I'm going to try and update the blog as I find new apps and features!
