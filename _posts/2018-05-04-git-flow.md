title: The Beauty of GitFlow
---

A little over a year and a half ago some colleagues and I really started pushing for a more sane branching strategy.
It was a bit of the wild west in terms of who could commit directly to master/develop and how things got merged in.
Part of this was great in that it allowed us to iterate extremely quickly, but also caused some major problems when
someone accidentally merged in some breaking code.

GitFlow is designed to work great for any sized team that is working in parallel on the same codebase. It has a process
built in to handle branches for QA and branches that are production ready. On top of that it has good support for both
hotfixes to branches live in production and bugfixes.

## How It Works: The Basics 

GitFlow was [designed](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by Vincent Driessen back in 2010, but
it really caught on back in [late 2013/early 2014](https://www.timqian.com/star-history/#nvie/gitflow). The main design
focuses around two main branches which never go away: **master** and **develop**. The head of **master** will always be a
production ready and the head of **develop** will always be the stable branch for development.

From there it's best to first check out the chart:

## How It Works: Other Branches

Outside of the two main branches, original GitFlow has three more branch types: **feature**, **release**, and 
**hotfixes**. On top of that I personally endorse having a fourth branch type called: **bugfix**.

The **feature** and **bugfix** branch types always come off of **develop**. the **feature** branch is always written as
*feature/ticket-#-my-cool-feature*. This is where all work for a new feature would be added. Once the feature has been
reviewed and is ready it is merged directly into the **develop** branch. When a bug is found in the develop branch a
new branch should be cut from develop and named *bugfix/ticket-#-fix-for-bug*. Once the bug has been fixed that gets
merged directly into develop.

The other two branch types are more focused around deployment and releasing. **release** (*release/ticket-#-ver-1_0_0*) 
will be cut off of **develop**, similarly to **feature** and **bugfix**, but in this case it's when we're ready 
to release a new version of our software. Release versions are where we do our final set of tests and have product check 
to make sure that everything is working as expected. If any issues are found then we would cut a new **bugfix** branch 
and that would get merged into both **develop** and **release**. Once finalized the **release** branch will get merged 
into **master** and a new tag will be cut. Tags are the way in which the software is released to the customer. 
Everything customer facing should be discussed in terms of tags.

The final branch is the **hotfix** branch. Any bugs that are found on a tag need to be dealt with immediately since they
are being seen by the customer. These fixes should always be done on a **hotfix** (*hotfix/ticket-#-hotfix-issue*) branch.
Once fixed, these branches get merged into both **develop** and **master**. 

## Why it works

The beauty of GitFlow is that developers don't get in each others way and that there is a process by which new things
are created and how things get fixed. No one is confused as to where things stand and you can say with confidence
that the **master** and **develop** branches will be stable for when you need to jump on something quickly.

## Happy Ending

I can happily say that at this point we've switched over to running GitFlow on all of our repos and it's made a
world of difference to both current and new devs. If you have any questions about GitFlow or how I've helped implement
it at places I've worked feel free to reach out.
