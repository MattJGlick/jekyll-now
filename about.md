I'm a full stack engineer based out of the Greater Philadelphia Area. I strive on solving problems and finding challenges. I've worked at places where complacency is the standard, I'm not interested in that. I'm looking to make change, improve process, and push myself to be the best software developer I can be.

### Interesting Projects 

[Amazon FBA Sourcing Analyzer](https://github.com/MattJGlick/fba-sourcing-analyzer): Node.js application that runs continuously on a Digital Ocean droplet scraping some key websites for Amazon deals. It makes a full analysis of all of the possible items, then using a personally designed algorithm determines if it is worth purchasing for resale at a later date.

[Amazon FBA Calculator](https://github.com/MattJGlick/amazon_fba_fee_calculator): Simple js file for evaluating Fulfillment By Amazon fees. Fully tested and utilized within other apps I have running.

[Habitica ToDo Exchange](https://github.com/MattJGlick/habitica_todo_exchange): Intermediary Node.js application that sits between IFTTT and Habitica. Allows me to use voice commands on Google Assistant to add tasks to my To-Do list on Habitica. I blogged about it [here]({% post_url 2016-12-20-habitica-google-assistant %}).

[Financial Independence Calculator](https://github.com/MattJGlick/FireCalc): Calculator for determining how long before someone can retire. Factors in age, investments, current income/expenses, future expeneses, etc. Long term I'd like to include a Monte Carlo simulation to determine possible outcomes and percentages.

[APUE Learning Unix](https://github.com/MattJGlick/learning_unix): I'm _slowly_ working through the book "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment", then adding some of the problems as I go. Working in a UNIX system has always been second nature to me, but fully understanding everything that's going on behind the scenes is where I have some gaps. Using this to attempt to fill them.

[dotfiles](https://github.com/MattJGlick/dotfiles): To make sure that I can easily get setup on a new computer I've got all of my configurations files stored on github, along with a script to do all the leg work. Overall setup time on a new machine is a few minutes.

[This blog](https://github.com/MattJGlick/mattjglick.github.io): Put this blog together using Jekyll, was a lot simpler than expected and was a fun experience. I'll eventually be looking into adjusting my themes/css.
